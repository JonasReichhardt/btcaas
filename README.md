# Bitcoin as a Sense

##### [Powered by CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin)

This project aims to use the human skin, the biggest receptor for stimulations to create a sense whichs focus is the current development of the Bitcoin price.  The price is recovered from the CoinDesk API every minute. The node.js application calculates the price difference to last minute and accordingly sends specific signals over a serial port to an Arduino Uno.  The microcontroller activates a tens unit to draw a arrow on the user's back with electronic muscle stimulation.

[The project is inspired by this Ted Talk from David Eagleman](https://www.youtube.com/embed/4c1lqFXHvqI)
